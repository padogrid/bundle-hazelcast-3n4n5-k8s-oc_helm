NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Start padogrid pod

SYNOPSIS
   $EXECUTABLE [storage_class] [-?]

DESCRIPTION
   Launches a PadoGrid pod with the name 'padogrid'. Padogrid keeps workspaces in the '/opt/padogrid/workspaces'
   directory. You can optionally mount that directory to a persistent volume as follows.

   CRC - For CRC, the storage_class must be 'local_storage'. If unspecified, then the persistent volume claim
         is not made.

   OCP - For OCP, you can specify any available storage class. If not specified then the default storage
        class is assigned.

   Execute the following command to list the available storage classes.

      oc get storageclass

OPTIONS
   storage_class
             The specified storage class is used as the Storage Class for the 'paodgrid-pvc' Persistent
             Volume Claim. If you are connected to CRC, then you must specify 'local-storage'. The 'local-storeage'
             persistent volumes must also be created beforehand as described in the bundle instructions.
             
             If this option is not specified, then the default storage class is assigned. For CRC, the
             default storage classs is undefined, and therefore, the persistent volume claim is not made
             and the container file system is used instead.
